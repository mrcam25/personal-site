                        <p>
                            As a Junior DevOps Engineer, I handle our infrastructure using Docker, Kubernetes, Rancher-Desktop, Helm, and AWS. I also create automation solutions with Linux, Bash, and Python to streamline processes and boost efficiency.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Monitoring is a key part of my role, and I use tools like Robusta, Prometheus, Grafana, and NewRelic to keep system performance in check. This helps me catch issues early and ensure everything runs smoothly.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            On a monthly basis, I prepare detailed AWS Billing Reports to track our cloud spending. I also run Penetration Tests to find and address security vulnerabilities, ensuring our systems remain secure and resilient.

                        <p>
                            In my role as a Junior Software Developer, I worked with Microsoft Azure and C# .NET, primarily within the Front Door/Legacy Integration Team. I built validations for JSON objects being passed to Front Door services using tools such as FluentValidations, Regex Pattern Matching, PostMan, and the .NET framework. This ensured that data was accurately processed and integrated.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Additionally, on the Physical Data Model/Integration Team, I was responsible for onboarding APIs to the Azure API Management Service. This involved creating and managing pipelines and releases through Azure DevOps. I also took charge of maintaining and updating the content on the Developer API Portal.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            These experiences provided me with a solid foundation in cloud infrastructure, API integration, and data validation, contributing significantly to my technical growth.

                            As a Software Developer Apprentice, I worked closely with the Central Database (CDB) Team on both the front and back end of the main application. My technical toolkit included Oracle Forms and Reports, PL/SQL, SQL Developer, Unix, and Serena Dimensions. I was involved in developing and maintaining various aspects of the application, gaining hands-on experience with these technologies.

                        <p>
                            A significant milestone in my apprenticeship was receiving email confirmation on March 10th, 2022, that I had successfully completed the program. This role provided me with a solid foundation in software development and database management, setting the stage for my subsequent career advancement.

                    <p>
                        I have been dedicated to weightlifting, focusing on Olympic lifts, with a rigorous training schedule of 1.5 hours per day, 5-6 days a week. Since April, I have achieved personal bests of 70kg in the Snatch and 84kg in the Clean and Jerk. These accomplishments reflect significant progress and commitment to the sport.

                    <p>
                        I am set to compete in my first-ever weightlifting competition on July 21st and have secured a place at the prestigious British Open in August. This journey has not only improved my lifting technique and strength but has also instilled a disciplined approach and competitive edge in my training.

                    <p>
                        I was actively involved in Ultimate Frisbee from 2015 to 2023, competing at an elite level in the sport. I represented teams at two prestigious world championships: Mooncatchers (BEL) 2018 in Cincinatti, USA and Great Britain (GBR) U24 Men 2019 in Heidelberg, Germany. Additionally, I played at the UK Nationals with Brighton Ultimate for many years, further demonstrating my competitive experience and dedication to the sport over nearly a decade.

                    <p>
                        Alongside my playing career, I made significant contributions to the Ultimate Frisbee community in Brighton. I served in various leadership roles on the committee, including Director of Performance and President. These roles enabled me to shape strategic decisions and support the growth of the local Ultimate Frisbee scene, leaving a lasting impact on both the sport and the community.

                    <p>
                        Since my formal apprenticeship, where UI design was not extensively covered, I have proactively pursued learning Frontend Design in my spare time. Recognizing the importance of modern design practices, I have dedicated myself to understanding various Frontend frameworks and libraries. This self-directed learning approach has allowed me to explore key technologies and tools essential for creating dynamic and user-centric web interfaces.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have been focusing on mastering React for developing interactive and efficient user interfaces and Laravel for backend development, which complements my frontend knowledge. Additionally, I am enhancing my skills with CSS frameworks such as Bulma and Tailwind CSS to build responsive and aesthetically pleasing web applications. Through hands-on projects and online courses, I am gaining practical experience in applying these technologies to create well-rounded and functional web solutions. This ongoing education not only enriches my technical expertise but also positions me to contribute more effectively to the evolving field of web development.
